Don't mind me. Yet...

Building
--------

A makefile is included for easing the building processes. The makefile assumes you have Node installed, as well as the Palm/HP webOS command-line tools. The makefile also provides some utilities that are just aimed at 

#### make build

Runs the standard Enyo2 minification and deployment process

#### make run

First, runs `build`, then installs and launches the application on a connected device using palm-install and palm-launch.

#### make debug

Runs `build` and `make`, and then follows logs on the device the application launched on.

#### make db8

Installs the db8 configurations on the currently connected webOS device. The configurations are set up when the operating system is built, and are not established by the app itself. Because of this, you will need to install the db kinds and permissions separately.
